Welcome to the Syndemics Lab Group Page. We are a research lab part of Boston Medical Center lead by Dr. Benjamin Linas. Our primary focuses are on Substance Use Disorder and associated diseases, with two major simulation models:
1. RESPOND
2. HEP-CE

### RESPOND ###
RESPOND is a state space cohort based simulation intended to model opioid use disorder (OUD) and the various treatments over time. 

### HEP-CE ###
HEP-CE is a microsimulation intended to model the spread of Hepatitis-C Virus and the progression amongst various groups.
