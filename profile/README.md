# Syndemics Lab at Boston Medical Center
Welcome to the [Syndemics Lab](https://syndemicslab.org). Under Lead Principal Investigator Benjamin P. Linas, we conduct research as part of Boston Medical Center.

## What We Do
Our team studies synergistic epidemics—*syndemics*—with a particular focus on
Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and substance
use disorders.  Our work is centered on using simulation and cost-effectiveness
analysis methods to evaluate current public health guidelines and policies,
primarily through use of our simulation models, RESPOND and HEP-CE.

### RESPOND

**R**esearching **E**ffective **S**trategies to **P**revent **O**pioid **D**eath
(`RESPOND`) is a population-level, cohort-based simulation model that simulates
populations with opioid use disorder through movements between health states
which represent varied substance use behaviors and different medical treatments
or interventions.

### HEP-CE

**Hep**atitis C **C**ost **E**ffectiveness (`HEP-CE`) is a Markov chain Monte
Carlo micro-simulation model focused on studying the syndemic of opioid use
disorder and the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HEP-CE models HCV incidence,
screening, linkage to care, treatment, and related morbidity risks, measuring
costs and quality-adjusted life years so that relative benefits of treatment
policies may be compared.
